## Vul detail
update_lens.cgi is a cgi interface that can be accessed in the device and can be accessed directly in the browser.

update_lens.cgi is a soft link in the system, and it is linked to upload_file.cgi.There is a command injection function in upload_file.cgi. The attacker only needs to construct the response payload to execute the response function to achieve the effect of arbitrary execution of the command.

We construct the corresponding payload to achieve denial of service and other attacks.
